# wasm-svelte

This is a proof-of-concept application showing integration between rust signals and svelte
stores.

The most important files are in `src/wasm/signals-are-svelte-stores`, which could in
theory be published to cargo, if I wasn't a coward. The rest of the repository is intended
as a demonstration of how this integration can be used.
